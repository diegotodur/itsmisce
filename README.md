I am a 21 year old young man and I am currently doing a bootcamp to become a full stack developer.

I have a diploma in management processes and innovation, as well as incomplete commercial engineering degree from UTFSM, Chile.

I consider myself someone with strong innovation skills, teamwork, fast learning and entrepreneurial mind.
